Hello GitHub Community!👋 Check out my first Power BI guided Project from Rishabh Mishra. The Objective is to help the company to reduce Attrition Rate and Improve overall Retention. Since it is my first Power BI Project, I try to focus on the basics of the Tool, Understanding the features and apply them to answer Business questions. I start with Cleaning and Processing the Data, Ensuring Data quality. Then, I aim to uncover Insights and turn Numbers into Stories to help both Technical and Non-Technical Audiences Understand the Data easily. I then explore the Insights shown on the detailed Dashboard, drawing Valuable Conclusions from the Analysis. Matt Mike's recent YouTube video helped me to ensure the Dashboard Quality and Minimalism. 📈📊
